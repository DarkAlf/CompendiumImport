CompendiumImport
================


The goal of this project is to import data from the web compendium to Masterplan libraries, so that DMs can easilyprepare games.

It's an addin you use from Masterplan, which connects to the Compendium automatically and convert the data to various Masterplan objects (Creatures, soon Traps & Hazard & Treasures). You have to be a D&D Insider suscriber, of course.

This project uses code from Rohit Agarwal ( http://refactoringaspnet.blogspot.ca/2010/04/using-htmlagilitypack-to-get-and-post.html ) and  the HtmlAgilityPack  parser. 

The work started on the right track thanks to Paige Watson ( http://paigew.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/creating-a-masterplan-add-on-part-1/ )

Without them, it would have been a lot worse...

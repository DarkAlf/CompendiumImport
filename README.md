CompendiumImport
================


The goal of this project is to import data from the [Dungeons & Dragons Compendium](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/compendium) to [Masterplan](http://masterplan.habitualindolence.net/) libraries, to help DMs prepare games.

This is an addin you use from Masterplan. It connects to the Compendium automatically and convert the data to various Masterplan objects (Creatures, soon Traps & Hazard & Treasures). You have to be a D&D Insider suscriber, of course.

I just moved this project here from [CodePlex](https://compendiumimport.codeplex.com/), just in case. 

I'm not playing 4e currently, and I don't have a Insider subscription anymore, so, I don't expect to work on it right now.

One of the things I'd like to do is to first continue to replace string comparisons by regular expressions. There's enough unit tests to refactor the code without trouble.

Thanks :

This project uses code from Rohit Agarwal ( http://refactoringaspnet.blogspot.ca/2010/04/using-htmlagilitypack-to-get-and-post.html ) and  the HtmlAgilityPack  parser. 

The work started on the right track thanks to Paige Watson ( http://paigew.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/creating-a-masterplan-add-on-part-1/ )

Without them, it would have been a lot worse...

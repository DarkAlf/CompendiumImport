CompendiumImport
================


The goal of this project is to import data from the web compendium to Masterplan libraries, so that DMs can easily prepare games.

This is an addin you use from Masterplan. It which connects to the Compendium automatically and convert the data to various Masterplan objects (Creatures, soon Traps & Hazard & Treasures). You have to be a D&D Insider suscriber, of course.

I just moved this project here from CodePlex, just in case. 

I'm not playing 4e currently, and I don't have a Insider subscription anymore, so, I don't expect to work on it right now.

One of the things I'd like to do is to first continue to replace string comparisons by regular expressions.

Thanks :

This project uses code from Rohit Agarwal ( http://refactoringaspnet.blogspot.ca/2010/04/using-htmlagilitypack-to-get-and-post.html ) and  the HtmlAgilityPack  parser. 

The work started on the right track thanks to Paige Watson ( http://paigew.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/creating-a-masterplan-add-on-part-1/ )

Without them, it would have been a lot worse...
